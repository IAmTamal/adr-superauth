# What is WallHub ? 🤔

WallHub is a webapp made with **ReactJs** , styled with **Bootstrap, CSS** and also using **Appwrite**, **Docker** as the backend. This webapp can be used to get acess to all the best quality UHD wallpapers for all your screens !!

## Available Scripts 👾

To setup the project in your local machine :

- **`git clone `** the repository
- **`npm install`** to run all the commands.
- Replace the project IDs, endpoints with your own.
- In **`Login.jsx`** change the URL for googleAuths.

## What did i learn ? 🍁

Making this app was an amazing experience.

- Got to learn about **setting up Docker** in your local machine.
- Setting up config for **Appwrite**
- Storing the registered user in the **storage** and creating a **local session**.
- Using **Google Authentication** for signing up !!

## Issues that might occur in the deployed version 🥴
- Login glitch
- Google auth endpoints might not work
I am trying to fix these ASAP, till then you might clone the repo, and test it.
